# HELLO WORLD PYTHON : LEARN BY DOING

## HOW TO GET STARTED

* Install Git and open a Github account
	If you haven't already, install Git. This is separate to Github. [Click here for a great video for helping you set it up on your computer and learn some useful functions of it] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)

* Clone this hello-world-python repository
	If you scroll up all the way you'll see a green "Code" button. Click on it and copy the whole https:// address.
	Open your Terminal/command line or Git Bash in a folder where you want to clone this whole repository. Then type "git clone" followed by the https you copied ( git clone https://... )

This will copy all the files to your computer. Check out each of the .py files and learn by running them and associating the outputs to the written code.
